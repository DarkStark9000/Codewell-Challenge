#Codewell-Challenge

What's the purpose of this repo?
Here, I have linked and organized my source code, assets, and final result link for all the challenges that I have completed from [Codewell Challenges](https://www.codewell.cc/challenges)

Why did I do it for?
I did these challenges as a part of my [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3A%20%40thedebarshidas%20%20%23100DaysOfCode&src=typed_query&f=top).

What did I gain?
While doing this, I got a concise refresher on many topics of basic HTML, CSS & JS. I learned quite a few neat tricks and new things like Flexbox and Grids. These challenges helped me to develop single-page applications and a simple website pretty quickly.

How can you benefit from this repo?
Well, if you are someone who is starting out with basic Web Dev or someone getting back into web dev and want a quick "learn by doing" practice, you can view the challenges here. You can also take references from my codebase.

Who am I?
I am [Debarshi Das]() as of writing this, in my pre-final year of my B.Tech from VIT, Chennai.
