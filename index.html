				A co-founder at one of the <br />

			<h5>
				The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500 companies
				has allowed me to developer a skillset that help me in not just
				development, but in every aspect of any business. <br /><br />
				I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one the world's largest
				communities teaching young minds about how to sell yourself as a
				developer and open them to a whole new world of opportunities.
				<br /><br />
			</h5>
			<h5>
				As a developer, you have everything available to you and all that's
				holding you back is yourself.
				<br /><br />
				A quote I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean.
				<br /><br />
				"How big would you dream, if you knew you wouldn't fail?" You've already
				gone through the hardest parts being a developer, it's time to elevate
				your skills and become a leader in something you're passionate about.
				<br /><br />
				I'm happy to chat over coffee some time about how I can help your
				company.
